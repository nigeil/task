For translators.


Taskwarrior has a 'task.pot' file, which is the template from which new
translations are created.  It gets out of date.  Refresh it using:

  cd task.git/po
  ./regen.sh

This will be integrated into the makefile soon.


Creating a new translation
--------------------------

  cd task.git/po
  msginit -i task.pot -o xx.po
  (add file to PO_FILES variable)


Updating an existing translation
--------------------------------

  cd task.git/po
  (edit xx.po)
  make
