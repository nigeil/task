"The general form of commands is:\n"
"  task [<filter>] <command> [<mods>]\n"
"\n"
"The <filter> consists of zero or more restrictions on which tasks to select, "
"such as:\n"
"  task                                      <command> <mods>\n"
"  task 28                                   <command> <mods>\n"
"  task +weekend                             <command> <mods>\n"
"  task project:Home due.before:today        <command> <mods>\n"
"  task ebeeab00-ccf8-464b-8b58-f7f2d606edfb <command> <mods>\n"
"\n"
"By default, filter elements are combined with an implicit 'and' operator, "
"but 'or' and 'xor' may also be used, provided parentheses are included:\n"
"  task '(/[Cc]at|[Dd]og/ or /[0-9]+/)'      <command> <mods>\n"
"\n"
"A filter may target specific tasks using ID or UUID numbers.  To specify "
"multiple tasks use one of these forms:\n"
"  task 1,2,3                                    delete\n"
"  task 1-3                                      info\n"
"  task 1,2-5,19                                 modify pri:H\n"
"  task 4-7 ebeeab00-ccf8-464b-8b58-f7f2d606edfb info\n"
"\n"
"The <mods> consist of zero or more changes to apply to the selected tasks, "
"such as:\n"
"  task <filter> <command> project:Home\n"
"  task <filter> <command> +weekend +garden due:tomorrow\n"
"  task <filter> <command> Description/annotation text\n"
"\n"
"Tags are arbitrary words, any quantity:\n"
"  +tag       The + means add the tag\n"
"  -tag       The - means remove the tag\n"
"\n"
"Built-in attributes are:\n"
"  description:    Task description text\n"
"  status:         Status of task - pending, completed, deleted, waiting\n"
"  project:        Project name\n"
"  priority:       Priority\n"
"  due:            Due date\n"
"  recur:          Recurrence frequency\n"
"  until:          Expiration date of a task\n"
"  limit:          Desired number of rows in report, or 'page'\n"
"  wait:           Date until task becomes pending\n"
"  entry:          Date task was created\n"
"  end:            Date task was completed/deleted\n"
"  start:          Date task was started\n"
"  scheduled:      Date task is scheduled to start\n"
"  depends:        Other tasks that this task depends upon\n"
"\n"
"Attribute modifiers make filters more precise.  Supported modifiers are:\n"
"  before     (synonyms under, below)\n"
"  after      (synonyms over, above)\n"
"  none\n"
"  any\n"
"  is         (synonym equals)\n"
"  isnt       (synonym not)\n"
"  has        (synonym contains)\n"
"  hasnt\n"
"  startswith (synonym left)\n"
"  endswith   (synonym right)\n"
"  word\n"
"  noword\n"
"\n"
"Alternately algebraic expressions support:\n"
"  and  or  xor            Logical operators\n"
"  <  <=  =  !=  >=  >     Relational operators\n"
"  (  )                    Precedence\n"
"\n"
"  task due.before:eom priority.not:L   list\n"
"  task '(due < eom or priority != L)'  list\n"
"\n"
"The default .taskrc file can be overridden with:\n"
"  task ... rc:<alternate file> ...\n"
"  task ... rc:~/.alt_taskrc ...\n"
"\n"
"The values in .taskrc (or alternate) can be overridden with:\n"
"  task ... rc.<name>=<value> ...\n"
"  task rc.color=off list\n"
"\n"
"Any command or attribute name may be abbreviated if still unique:\n"
"  task list project:Home\n"
"  task li       pro:Home\n"
"\n"
"Some task descriptions need to be escaped because of the shell:\n"
"  task add \"quoted ' quote\"\n"
"  task add escaped \\' quote\n"
"\n"
"The argument -- tells taskwarrior to treat all other args as description, "
"even if they would otherwise be attributes or tags:\n"
"  task add -- project:Home needs scheduling\n"
"\n"
"Many characters have special meaning to the shell, including:\n"
"  $ ! ' \" ( ) ; \\ ` * ? { } [ ] < > | & % # ~\n"
